🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

Machine Learning project to predict wine quality using various physicochemical features.

📌 Overview

This project builds a predictive model to estimate wine quality (typically on a 0–10 scale) using attributes like acidity, alcohol level, pH, sugar, and more. It demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline — from preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation — all inside a single Jupyter Notebook.

✅ Features

✔ End-to-end ML workflow
✔ Data cleaning & preprocessing
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Model training (Regression / Classification)
✔ Performance evaluation
✔ Visual insights & feature interpretation

📊 Dataset

The dataset is typically from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains attributes such as:

Feature	Description
Fixed acidity	Tartaric acid level
Volatile acidity	Acetic acid level
Citric acid	Wine freshness indicator
Residual sugar	Sugar content
Chlorides	Salt content
Free sulfur dioxide	SO₂ level (free)
Total sulfur dioxide	SO₂ level (total)
Density	Liquid density
pH	Acidity level
Sulphates	Antioxidant level
Alcohol	Alcohol percentage
Quality (Target)	Sensory score (0–10)

📌 Place your dataset in the /data folder with the filename winequality.csv.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

(Add others you used if needed.)

🚀 Getting Started
✅ 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction

✅ 2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

✅ 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, list the libraries manually.)

✅ 4. Run the Notebook
jupyter notebook wine-quality-prediction.ipynb

📈 Model Workflow

Load dataset

Handle missing values

Visualize and analyze correlations

Split into training and testing sets

Train models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.)

Evaluate using metrics (RMSE, MAE, R² or Accuracy/F1 if classified)

✅ Example Metrics (Customizable)

Accuracy: 0.87

RMSE: 0.62

R² Score: 0.82

Top features: Alcohol, Volatile acidity, Sulphates

(Replace with your actual results.)

🌟 Future Enhancements

✅ Hyperparameter tuning

✅ Export model as .pkl

✅ Classification-based approach

✅ Streamlit/Flask deployment

✅ CI/CD integration
